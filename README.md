## Preview

### Well thought-out visualization elements

![alt visu elements](https://www.hvac-automation.com/files/inhalte/hvac/Landingpage%20HVAC/heatingcurve.gif)

Place finished and perfectly thought-out visualisation elements with only a few mouse clicks - on the left, in the example, a finished heating circuit and an adjustable heating curve.

- Visualisation elements are available as macros
- Design adjustments can be made individually 
- Easy and quick placement of the macros by drag'n'drop

### Functionality for manual override

![alt manual override](https://www.hvac-automation.com/files/inhalte/hvac/Landingpage%20HVAC/manualmode.gif)

With the manual override, you can override the automatic mode on the software side and reach the desired state. 
A finished Visu object, as well as an easy-to-use functional component, is available for this purpose. Of course, the function is available for both analogue and digital values. 
All manual overrides can be reset at a central overall control unit.

### Integrated vacation, special times and public holidays functionality

![alt vacation functionality](https://www.hvac-automation.com/files/inhalte/hvac/Landingpage%20HVAC/holidayfunction.gif)

Finished system for vacation days/works holidays, as well as public holidays and special times,  can be specified. 

With this macro, the user can intuitively define "exception times" that influence the control of their system. But even you, as a programmer, benefit from this macro, as you can use the settings in a recurring manner and simply via an interface in the program.

### Placing of elements via drag and drop

![alt placing elements](https://www.hvac-automation.com/files/inhalte/hvac/Landingpage%20HVAC/DragNDrop.gif)

All visualisation elements can be easily selected from an available pool of macros and placed via drag and drop.

### User-friendly parameterisation of the functional components

![alt parameterisation](https://www.hvac-automation.com/files/inhalte/hvac/Landingpage%20HVAC/parameterwindow.gif)

All functional components can be parameterised in a user-friendly manner with the assistance of the parameter window. Thus, all parameters in the program are persistent and will be retained after restarting a controller.
